<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>TL;DR</strong> - If you end up with an invalid filename on Windows, you can manipulate the file using the secret DOS name.<br />
<!--more--></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There's a folder on my Windows 7 machine that I can't delete! It's called <code>Goldberg Variations BWV 988</code> and was created when I backed up a CD with Media Player.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Why can't it be deleted? Doing so gives an error saying it doesn't exist:</p>
<p><a href="http://ejrh.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/cant-delete1.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2173" title="cant-delete" src="assets/cant-delete1.png" alt="" width="496" height="248" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And yet there it is. Does it have any funny permissions? Nope. In fact it doesn't seem to have any permissions at all:</p>
<p><a href="http://ejrh.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/cant-view-perms.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2171" title="cant-view-perms" src="assets/cant-view-perms.png" alt="" width="377" height="487" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hrm. Is it corrupted? Chkdsk doesn't seem to think so.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Let's try deleting it from the command prompt:</p>
<pre>E:\incoming\Bach&gt;dir

 Volume in drive E is enormous
 Volume Serial Number is 7081-2770

 Directory of E:\incoming\Bach

05/07/2012  08:23 p.m.    &lt;DIR&gt;          .
05/07/2012  08:23 p.m.    &lt;DIR&gt;          ..
16/01/2012  01:07 p.m.    &lt;DIR&gt;          Goldberg Variations BWV 988

E:\incoming\Bach&gt;rmdr "Goldberg Variations BWV 988 "
The system cannot find the file specified.</pre>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Um, what's that space doing there? (I tab-completed the name.) Let's try a few tricks:</p>
<pre>E:\incoming\Bach&gt;rmdir "Goldberg Variations BWV 988?"
The filename, directory name, or volume label syntax is incorrect.

E:\incoming\Bach&gt;rmdir "Goldberg Variations BWV 988*"
The filename, directory name, or volume label syntax is incorrect.</pre>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Nope. Windows Media Player has somehow created a file with a name that isn't valid, and hence can't be removed by anything.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But wait, ancient lore from the 90s might have something to say. Being the layer-upon-crufty-layer of bloatware that it is, Windows contains a lot of legacy functionality. Including full "support" for the fixed 11 character filenames of <a href="en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOS">DOS</a>. Almost every single file on a modern Winodws 7 NTFS drive from 2012 has a secret DOS name, too. Just in case an app written in 1983 wants to open it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The DOS names are not hard links. They are alternative names for the real links. (So if you create a hardlink, you get a DOS name for the new hardlink, too.) They are created, by default, on NTFS volumes for files whose real names do not fit within the original 8.3 DOS scheme.</p>
<pre>E:\incoming\Bach&gt;dir/?
Displays a list of files and subdirectories in a directory.

...
  /X          This displays the short names generated for non-8dot3 file
              names.  The format is that of /N with the short name inserted
              before the long name. If no short name is present, blanks are
              displayed in its place.
...

E:\incoming\Bach&gt;dir /x

16/01/2012  01:07 p.m.    &lt;DIR&gt;          GOLDBE~1     Goldberg Variations BWV 988</pre>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><code>GOLDBE~1</code>, eh? I would never have guessed.</p>
<pre>E:\incoming\Bach&gt;rmdir goldbe~1</pre>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><code>:o</code></p>
<pre>E:\incoming\Bach&gt;dir /x
 Volume in drive E is enormous
 Volume Serial Number is 7081-2770

               2 Dir(s)  151,020,306,432 bytes free</pre>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Gone. Some of that bloaty legacy code is useful, after all.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">NetBeans gave me an interesting code hint today: <code>Thread.sleep called in loop</code>.<br />
<!--more--></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">StackOverflow <a title="NetBeans / Java / New hint: Thread.sleep called in loop, at StackOverflow" href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3535754/netbeans-java-new-hint-thread-sleep-called-in-loop">provides some discussion</a> on what's so dangerous about sleeping, and what we're supposed to use instead. The hint seems mainly to be aimed at programmers who use a blocking delay in polling loops, allegedly to the detriment of performance. It's preferable instead to have some service notify the program when input is available.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Of course, sometimes that's just not practicable (for instance, when input is in the form of a file changed on disk by an external program). But nonetheless, "best practice" demands that we prepare for the future and write it using a <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/ExecutorService.html">executor service</a>. Initially the service does little more than add a lot of boilerplate to an internal implementation of "do task, sleep, repeat". But it could, ostensibly, in principal, hypothetically, in an ideal world, be changed to one which immediately performed the task in response to the file changing, or which ran multiple tasks in parallel.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, rather than code like this:</p>
<p>[sourcecode language="java"]public void run() {<br />
    while (true) {<br />
        processData();</p>
<p>        if (!keepGoing())<br />
            break;</p>
<p>        try {<br />
            Thread.sleep(pollingFrequency);<br />
        } catch (InterruptedException ex) {<br />
            logger.log(Level.SEVERE, &quot;Unexpected exception while sleeping&quot;, ex);<br />
        }<br />
    }<br />
}[/sourcecode]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The "correct" Java code is instead:</p>
<p>[sourcecode language="java"]import java.util.concurrent.Executors;<br />
import java.util.concurrent.ScheduledExecutorService;<br />
import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit;</p>
<p>public void run() {<br />
    final ScheduledExecutorService service = Executors.newSingleThreadScheduledExecutor();</p>
<p>    Runnable processDataCmd = new Runnable() {<br />
        @Override<br />
        public void run() {<br />
            processData();</p>
<p>            if (!keepGoing())<br />
                service.shutdown();<br />
        }<br />
    };</p>
<p>    service.scheduleAtFixedRate(processDataCmd, 0, pollingFrequency, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS);<br />
}[/sourcecode]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second form does have the advantage that the ugly and useless handling of <code>InterruptedException</code> is hidden. Possibly more usefully, it means other code can be run in the meantime, while the service is happily running my task at regular intervals. The problem is that it's not going to be obvious that the executor is still running; spawning off the polling like this separates it from subsequent code, which is only useful if there is going to be no connection between the two parts.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I'm not altogether sure that it gives a net readability gain in my program.</p>

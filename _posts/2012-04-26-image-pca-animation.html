<p style="text-align:justify;">A short follow up to the earlier post on <a title="Images inÂ space" href="http://ejrh.wordpress.com/2012/04/22/images-in-space/">image analysis</a>. We can cram another principal component into the visualisation by going 3D. This animation depicts the first three components as spatial coordinates, and the second three as colour coordinates.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">(There is a little POV-Ray sphere for each data point.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is an obvious shape and colour distribution. For instance, one end of the main body is blue, and the other is pink. I have to wonder if that implies a bug in my PCA algorithm. It is supposed to select orthogonal components.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">How can I test it? It's a bit hard with 13 dimensions for each of 136742 data points. A smaller test case is necessary.</p>

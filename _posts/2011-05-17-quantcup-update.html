<p style="text-align:justify;">Yesterday I received an email update from the <a title="Price-time matching engine" href="http://ejrh.wordpress.com/2011/04/21/price-time-matching-engine/">QuantCup challenge</a>.  This was surprising, as it's the first I've heard from them since attempting to register.<br />
<!--more--></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The existing entries have been re-scored against new hardware and the table updated.  I'm still not sure if I'm properly registered, but I sent my preliminary entry in anyway.  I'll have to wait till the next update to see how well it does (assuming I remembered my contest display name correctly, and they accept me).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The example implementation scores 14500 with the current leader at 750; that's 95% reduction.  On my previous tests my reduction was 79%.  So the competition now looks rather tough!  There's still room for algorithmic improvement in mine and I haven't done any constant factor optimisation (AKA as <a title="When to optimise at Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Program_optimization#When_to_optimize">premature optimisation</a> :p).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Update.</strong> The contest organiser Pranava Adduri has run my entry; see the <a title="Leader board on the QuantCup home page" href="http://www.quantcup.org/">leader board</a>. :-)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Update 2.</strong>  Pranava has got back to me and confirmed my suspicions about ineligibility.  Oh well!  It's still a fun contest -- I still recommend it to any students familiar with C (the programming language; prefereably not the grade :p).</p>

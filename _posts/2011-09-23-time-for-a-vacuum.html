<p style="text-align:justify;">A graph of CPU, Motherboard and Graphics card temperatures so far this year.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Since getting this machine I've been <a title="Monitoring hardware" href="http://ejrh.wordpress.com/2011/02/25/monitoring-hardware/">collecting hardware measurements</a> from it. I thought I should try to see if there are any trends developing.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_1133" align="aligncenter" width="640" caption="Average daily temperature readings for SMAUG; the machine was dormant in June/July."]<a href="http://ejrh.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/cpu-temp1.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-1133" title="cpu-temp" src="assets/cpu-temp1.png" alt="" width="640" height="465" /></a>[/caption]<br />

<p style="text-align:justify;">It's kind of tricky because the database has readings from almost a million time points in it, with 36 measurements for each. Ad hoc queries can take a bit of forethought. There's also the fact that at some times I might be playing a game on its maximum video settings and at others I might be doing practically nothing. I normally only do any one intensive activity for a few hours a day, so the average reading for each day should be a reasonable indication of any long-term changes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A factor that could affect it over the medium- or long-term are a change in the type of game I want to play at that time.  I was playing <a title="Neverwinter Nights 2" href="http://ejrh.wordpress.com/2011/05/08/neverwinter-nights-2/">Neverwinter Nights 2</a> in April which could explain the shape of the graphics data at that time.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">My first graph was just of CPU temperature; I was curious to see a gradual upward trend there. Was it dust accumulating in the fans? Or it could just be a different typical use of it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There's no obvious corresponding trend in the motherboard or graphics card temperatures. So nothing serious to worry about. Though I guess checking the CPU fan and heat sink for dust won't do any harm.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Update.</strong> Yes, it was!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I've opened the case and found quite a bit of dust.  It's on the external fans (which are easily cleaned); but there's also a faint layer over most the surfaces, such as the graphics card.  I've attempted to remove it but I don't want to actually touch any of it since the circuitry is exposed there (and I don't have any antistatic cleaning equipment handy).  Finally, the CPU fan and heatsink especially were starting to clog with dust.  I have cleaned them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The result is that CPU temperature has dropped by about 10 degrees.</p>

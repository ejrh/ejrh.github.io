<p style="text-align:justify;">I'm putting more of it on the web.<br />
<!--more--></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I've been seeing on r/programming more and more links about <a title="GitHub" href="http://github.com/">GitHub</a> and how important it is for programmers to have a "portfolio" (and how GitHub is perfect for that). Well, I still don't like Git much. And I'm pretty self-conscious about publishing stuff (however much this blog may seem to refute that).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But for some reason I've suddenly decided to do just that. Just not with GitHub, or Git. Or calling it a portfolio.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Part of the impetus was my recent work on replay.py, which is a Python script I hacked up for importing the <a title="Ur-Quan Masters home page" href="http://sc2.sourceforge.net/">UQM</a> changes into our <a title="Project 6014" href="http://code.google.com/p/project6014/">Project 6014</a> repository. I had a sudden realisation that I could use it do maintain a public <a title="Subversion" href="http://subversion.apache.org">Subversion</a> repository as a partial clone of my private one. I'd create an "ejrh" project on Google Code, and automatically replay commits to my personal repo there. Possibly using an import branch, just as I do for Project 6014.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then I thought a bit more and decided I could just use svnsync to keep the Google Code one up date. So much for the excitement of finally doing distributed version control...</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Anyway, here it is at: <a title="Edmund's various projects and other free stuff" href="http://code.google.com/p/ejrh/">http://code.google.com/p/ejrh/</a>. As of now I've only listed what I want to put there. The Subversion repository there is empty. Once I've double checked my private one for sensitive/irrelevant cruft, that repo will start filling up. With free stuff! Some of it might even be useful.</p>

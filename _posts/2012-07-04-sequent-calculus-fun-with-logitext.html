<p style="text-align:justify;">(This post is overdue; I've been more than usually busy at work on a new project, and have not had the energy to do anything interesting when I get home. Well, I saw this a while ago and today out of the blue remembered something interesting in relation to it. So I'll start by posting about Logitext since it's a pretty nicely made tool, and because the sequent calculus always deserves a bit of publicity.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On Reddit some time ago, I saw <a href="http://logitext.ezyang.scripts.mit.edu/main">Logitext</a>. It's a web-based <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequent_calculus">sequent calculus</a> explorer. It's like a short text-book on the sequent calculus, with one special feature: the examples in it will change in response to input.<br />
<!--more--></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Like (I suppose) many computer scientists, I used to wonder: <em>proving stuff is so hard and seems to require either miraculous leaps of intuition, or hopelessly intractable brute force searches over the set of proof derivations. How then am I supposed to write a program to do it?</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The sequent calculus provides one answer: represent the proof as a tree, and define a few rules for growing branches until the tree is complete -- in other words, until all the leaves of that tree are axioms. Start with the proposition to be proved as the unadorned root of a tree. Then, at each step, there are a finite number of rules that can be applied to grow the tree. (Wikipedia and the Logitext <a href="http://logitext.ezyang.scripts.mit.edu/logitext.fcgi/tutorial">tutorial</a> explain it better.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A program that proves even simple theorems like <code>p -&gt; (q -&gt; p)</code> can be a hard thing to implement naively. Having parsed the proposition into a term, where do you start proving it? In the sequent calculus, you parse it into the sequent <code>|= p -&gt; (q -&gt; p)</code>, and have a finite number of options on what to do next. One of which is the introduction rule for <code>-&gt;</code>: move the <code>p</code> into the antecedent, creating a branch <code>p |= q -&gt; p</code>. Performing it again grows to <code>p, q |= p</code>. And finally, a structural rule lets us remove <code>q</code> to finally grow a leaf: the axiom <code>p |= p</code>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is represented as a tree (a trivial one with no branching, in this case):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">$latex \cfrac{\cfrac{\cfrac{\cfrac{}{p \vdash p} \quad (I)}<br />
{p, q \vdash p} \quad (WL)}<br />
{p \vdash q \to p} \quad (\to R)}<br />
{\vdash p \to (q \to p)} \quad (\to R)$</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One of the great properties of the LK system in sequent calculus is that it has the <em>subformula property</em>: all the terms needed to complete a proof are subterms of the initial proposition. So a program only needs to apply rules using those terms, and can be sure that it will find a proof if one exists.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I've forgotten a lot since I last studied it in... 2006, but some memories are coming back. We had an assignment to implement a theorem prover in Prolog, using the LJ and LK systems. It was remarkably easy, except for the feature for converting a proof, easily found with the sequent calculus, into a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_deduction">natural deduction</a> proof. I have to confess I've not figured that part out yet...</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Footnote.</strong> I played with Logitext earlier this year. But today -- due to, perhaps, a cosmic ray -- it suddenly occurred to me that it should look eerily familiar. After all, my own Lambda Calculus Explorer was the same thing: terms are presented as part of a web page, and clicking on parts of them will result in the creation of new terms. Tragically (or perhaps as a serendipitous reprieve for blog readers) I no longer have PHP and JavaScript code for it. But I did salvage these slides out of Gmail:</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li><a href="http://ejrh.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/presentation-hide-notes.pdf">A tool for learning the lambda calculus</a></li>
<p> (a short presentation about my honours project on Simplifying Beta-reductions).
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Few outside my supervisor and circle of reviewers must have known of the Lambda Calculus Explorer. I thought it was moderately original at the time, but I can only wonder how many other web-based formal system explorers there are out there.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">I was confronted with this <a title="CAPTCHA at Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAPTCHA">CAPTCHA</a> today:</p>
<p><a href="http://ejrh.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/captcha.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1310" title="captcha" src="assets/captcha.png" alt="" width="498" height="293" /></a><br />

<p style="text-align:justify;">My response to it confirms that, not only am I a human, but I'm one that thinks like a computer. <code>;-)</code></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This isn't the first mathy one I've had by a long shot, but I think it's the first time that I put in some proper typesetting effort. In hindsight, I know I should have specified <code>\mathsf</code> for the superscript T, but my LaTeX skills have rusted since a I left academia.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When I see a formula like this, I always wonder what it means. I can only guess that $latex y^T$ is the transpose of <var>y</var>, but then I'm not used to seeing matrices in lowercase. Could <var>y</var> be some other matrix-like type? It's possible this is a commonly-known construction that I should be ashamed of not recognising. But then I only scored better than 63% of the population in <a title="The Difficult Math Quiz at OKCupid" href="http://www.okcupid.com/tests/the-difficult-math-test">The Difficult Math Quiz</a>, and I supposedly have a degree in the subject. Incidentally, a lot of that quiz comes down to guessing what formulas mean, or which formulas look plausible, without context of where in math they are used -- not unlike my conundrum with this one.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The reason I'm joining StumbleUpon now is that I've had a surge in traffic from it in the last 24 hours. I thought I should have a look at how it works and see why my blog is featuring on it. Not that I'm complaining in the slightest.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Update.</strong> Duh.  <em>y</em> is a vector, and <em>Q</em> is a square matrix.  Now it starts to look more plausible.  Is it part of a <a title="Markov chain at Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain">Markov chain</a> formula?  I can't believe I don't know this stuff.</p>

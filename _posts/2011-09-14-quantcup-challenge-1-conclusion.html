<p style="text-align:justify;">The <a title="QuantCup home page" href="http://www.quantcup.org/">QuantCup</a> challenge I previously <a title="Price-time matching engine" href="http://ejrh.wordpress.com/2011/04/21/price-time-matching-engine/">posted about</a> has finished.<br />
<!--more--></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After my entry was <a title="QuantCup update" href="http://ejrh.wordpress.com/2011/05/17/quantcup-update/">submitted and scored</a>, the scoreboard was divided into two tabs: official entries, and enthusiasts. Interest must have picked up because a lot of new names have populated the scoreboard. I wonder if any students from my local University entered after I sent pointed out the contest to them? It would be great if at least a few other NZers were in it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There was obviously plenty of scope for optimisation. The winning score was almost twice as good as my last submission; well done to voyager. I suspect, in my entry's case, general improvements in latency and particular improvements in the skip list usage would have helped the most. Micro-optimisations in the general code may have helped a little, though I expect the C compiler has already picked the low hanging fruit there. I would be interested in seeing the other programs. The terms of the contest don't specify publication of the entries but there's no harm in being optimistic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In any case, my entry's code is now at <a title="Edmund's QuantCup entry on Google Code" href="http://code.google.com/p/ejrh/source/browse/trunk/match">http://code.google.com/p/ejrh/source/browse/trunk/match</a>. It's of historical interest (if any) now. (I note that the scoring data -- a C file -- constitutes the largest part of Ohloh's <a title="EJRH project at Ohloh" href="https://www.ohloh.net/p/ejrh">estimate</a> of "my" programming output.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I look forward to seeing QuantCup challenge 2!</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Yesterday I had someone comment favourably on the "linkage" in my blog. Generally when I write a post, I try to refer back to one or two existing posts on the same topic. So in theory, there is an ever-growing <a title="Hasse diagram at Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hasse_diagram">Hasse diagram</a> of posts. In practice, it's nothing so pretty:</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_1865" align="aligncenter" width="640" caption="Internal link structure of EJRH"]<a href="http://ejrh.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/blog-topology4.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-1865" title="blog-topology" src="assets/blog-topology4.png" alt="" width="640" height="443" /></a>[/caption]<br />
<!--more--></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The hexagonal EJRH node is the home page, and it links to the categories (ellipses) and pages (rounded rectangles). Posts are rectangles and are linked according to their <a title="Pingbacks in WordPress" href="http://en.support.wordpress.com/pingbacks/">pingbacks</a>. Pingbacks are normally inter-blog, but the major commenter on my own posts is me by way of other posts.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When I see components of one or two isolated posts, I feel a strong urge to retroactively connect them to something.Â  At least the graph has the property of planarity, even if it's not drawn that way.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The diagram was drawn with yEd, using data generated from the WordPress export file and processed with a stylesheet into <a title="GraphML home page" href="http://graphml.graphdrawing.org/">GraphML</a>. The stylesheet also draws links from the categories to their constituent posts, but that makes the diagram really messy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The graph above is just an image, but in yEd the nodes are also hyperlinks to their respective blog locations; perhaps there's a way to integrate it into WordPress...</p>
